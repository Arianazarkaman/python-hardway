# python-hardway 
i am going to show you how to run these files on your own computer  

to run each of these files you must use python3 "name of the file"  

and that's it but there is something i must say before you go and do them  

not all of these files will be run like that some files have to get more values  

for a better knowledge of how to use these files it is better to study the book that i wrote these files from  

so this is just a repository for you to shorten the time of writing all the codes and also a resume for me
